Run make to build a working elasticsearch docker image

 make

Then you can run your image. For instance, if you want to keep your
elasticsearch db in /tmp/elastic-storage (maybe not the best place) :

 docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -v /tmp/elastic-storage/log/:/var/log/elasticsearch -v /tmp/elastic-storage/data/:/var/lib/elasticsearch/ pgrange/elasticsearch
